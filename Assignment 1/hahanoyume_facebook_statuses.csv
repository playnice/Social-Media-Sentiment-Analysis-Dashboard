_______________________________________________________

Furisode Series - The Language of Flowers. 

The fabric reminisces the language of flowers, Hanakotoba, meant to convey emotion and communicate directly to each other without needing the use of words. Flower symbolism plays a vital role in Japanese art, literature and everyday life.

Symbols and motifs have always been an integral part of Japanese aesthetics, both in traditional and modern designs. 

Cranes represent longevity and good fortune, perfect combination of good blessings for the new year.

The Chrysanthemum is a symbol of endurance and rejuvenation, whilst the cherry blossom has been revered by the Japanese and closely associated with its philosophy of mono no aware.
