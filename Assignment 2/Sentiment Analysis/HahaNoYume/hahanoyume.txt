Its time people leave the past where it belongs : in the past. Going on and on and on non-stop about what happened in the past will not make you any better. My family elders were victims during Japanese occupation in Malaya back then, life was hell but today they choose to let go instead of yabbering non-stop about it. SO WHAT if they apologize and so what if they didn't? Letting go is for your own inner peace, and let karma take care of the rest.
But they invaded other countries, killed the you

ng n old, raped the women n forced some to become prostitutes in the military just to satisfy their soldiers!

And yet until today, they refused to admit the crimes they have  committed n refused to apologise!

Hi Charlene. Sent you a pm. Pls check your other folder. Thanks! :)
12 months onward? Will there be more choices if shop online? Hope there'll be more collection and bigger size thank you 😃
Hi Sharon! Thanks for your interest! We will be launching our preorder sale tomorrow for our 1-3 yo kimono tops and dresses ☺️ [[PHOTO]]
Ok. Thanks. Is there any bigger size of romper / jumpsuit? I preferred that than tops. Hehe.
We don't have any rompers beyond 12 mo for the time being. In the near future for sure! Our rompers can actually fit up to 2 yo, depending on how big and heavy the child is. As long as the child is below 12kg, he/she can still fit ☺️
My boy is quite heavy he weighs about 10 plus kilo now, he's 8 months old. I'll go home check on the size. Lol.
He can still fit in our romper!  ☺️
What size should i order for my 2 year old girl?
Hi Charlene. You can order the 18-24 mo ☺️
I just ordered 2-3...hahaha.....too big? She can grow into it. Will bank in soon.
Hi Charlene. Perhaps you can refer to the size chart below. Wouldn't want your precious girl wait too long to wear our beautiful dress ;) [[PHOTO]]
Gosh...you are right. 20.5 inches is quite long..

Hahaha...do kids usually wear leggings underneath?
You can wear leggings if you want. Or without. It's versatile ☺️
My 1 yo wore without ☺️ [[PHOTO]]
Too cute! But since its only 1 inch difference between sizes....i may go for the longer one.
Last Friday I measure my boy size. He seems can fit on the romper. Hopefully can fit him well! Want him wear for photo shooting at studio. Lol.
You may also drop us a message on our FB page to place order ☺️
I hope they hav 4yo size!!!!!!!
Hi Xiao Wei! Our 2-3 yo tops and dresses can fit 4 yo very comfortably ☺️
18-24mth?
Hi Priscilla. We will launch our 1-3 yo tops and dresses range in sept. Will announce when it'll be available in TriBeCa as well. Stay tuned! ☺️
Ooh nice! At my friend's shop.
Love them!
