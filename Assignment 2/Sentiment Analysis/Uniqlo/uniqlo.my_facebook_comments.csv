hiloo.. i had a terrible experience at your branch at times square today. your security guard treat me like im a pencuri!. heloo..agak-agak juga la kalau nak mengawal barang dari kena curik..takkan nak follow saya dan jeling-jeling so many times!!! even saya try baju dekat mirror luar tu pun security tu standing next to me!. twice! 3 orang security works there..2 with uniform dan satu with baju biasa. body language pun sudah tahu mereka suspect saya nak curi dan sentiasa tengok gerak geri i. tapi mereka tak pun alert customer lain? why?? so frustating la!. then..bila I cari tak jumpa yang berkenan(actually im looking for jacket) saya tanya staff if there any model lain dekat branch yang lain. so dia suggest i pergi fahrenheit sebab sana branch besar. before i leave..i bagi tau pasal security tu asyik follow i..staff tu hanya tersengih je...apa ni?. then i pergi fahrenheit branch. besar 3 tingkat..tapi tak jumpa juga baju i berkenan. even baju yang ada dekat times square pun i tak nampak sini. dekat branch ni security dia tak macam times square pula. I bebas pilih baju tanpa stress kena suspect mencurik!!!!! tapi I terpaksa back to times square pulak. second  time for today sebab Fahrenheit kurang pilihan. u know lepas I masuk sana times square branch your security sudah tak act macam 1st I masuk 1 hour ealier!  why?????????? and second time I complaint to counter staff a Chinese guy. He apologize on behave of the security guard.  i bukan sekali je masuk uniqlo ye. KL sentral dan sogo is my fav branch. tapi mmg 1st time masuk times square branch. please ask your manager on duty to check CCTV on today macam mana security u treat me. saya bukan sampah..saya bukan pencurik! So upset and disappointed. Please take action. TQ
Haha   ..wat for security ikut setiap saat.....tak selesa la macam tu .....
"Saya pernah masuk guardian, security guard ikut saya, maybe sbb pakai backpack.. Dia ikut saya... Jadi saya bawa dia pusing2 sampai at one point saya yang ikut dia... Bila dia sedar, dia senyum n stopped following me."
Saya pon pernah kene dekat watson..ank2 ckp security tgok je..so saya sound kuat sikit..ingat x de RM nk bli ke!! Trus die blah..hihihi..melampau sgt..agak2 la..

Now uniqlo mark my comment as spam. Bravo. They do not want people to know what I have revealed.
I think the winners scored 10000++ points lol
more than that. can refer to my comment last time.
Where to look for?
I posted here previously but is marked as spammed by Uniqlo Malaysia
refer to the 1st week winner post. I wrote the details comment and how uniqlo ignoring me.
check the winners of 1st week and 2nd week. you can find the same name winner.
I played but did not even get the participation voucher 😢😭

Thanks for revealing as I find it very weird as well not able to make it to the top.
"As you guy can see, 1st week runner up and 2nd week 1st winner are the same person. Bravo Uniqlo.Just prove it is a cheat game"

"Bravo, uniqlo deleted my commented post. The result are untrusted. Complaint to them but no response from them and no action being taken. First contest not revealing the top score to show the real result of all time. All the time they try to hide the result so that they can manupulate the result as they wanted. Uniqlo malaysia not trying to be open . This is the value they are trying to preach. They wasted our time trying hard to play a fair game. It is just a marketting geek to lure people to play. So do not waste your time."
I saw ur profile picture in the latest standing
"My highest score is 146. Guess top5 scores should b around 180?- 190?
Guess max score wont higher than 200"
"If i told you my score to be 201, then do you believe you are able to acheive that score in the game even you pick up all the stuff?"
so do you believe it to be a fair game? Although I complaint but not response.
"Dear Yamazaki Ry, we apologise for the misunderstanding caused. It was a mistake done our side that the winners announced with the wrong prize. We then deleted the post and repost it with the correct prizes. Please be ensured that the winners remain the same."
"if it was a mistake, mistake for all prizes?only deleted after I made the comment and make the changes to prizes?"
not going to reveal the scores as I have said are true?
"We apologise as we made a mistake on all the prizes and hence rectified immediately. We sincerely apologise on that. However, as per our T&C, we do not reveal the scores to the public. Again, we apologise and thank you for your feedback. Do share with us your thoughts for us to improve for future references."
Nvr mind later I will compile a post showing impossible to make it to the top list. So is a cheat game to lure people playing and spend money with the RM10 given voucher and waste our time.
"Today scored 148, still no chance for position no5."
Told you. Read my comment . Impossibel to make it to the top 5.
🍿
Later I will try to compile the evidence this is not a fair game as I have already complaint to them last time but no action and response from them except the read tick.
"1. First I wasted my time playing the game. As you guy who played the game then you should know few things
   - impossible to pick up all the orange
   - impossible to skip all the lion head
   - limited golden bar
2. So by calculating available orange + available golden bar in 1 game, then if able to achieve 150 and above is very hard.
3. 1 time I scored 162 points but still not making it to the top list making me sceptical about this top list. 
   So it made me believe some sort of manipulation of the result in the backend.
4. So I message uniqlo about my findings and told them is a cheat game but not response from them at all making me unhappy."
"5. Then I tried to ask someone to check if able to hack the game score to see to top list score. Then after trying , the person told me
   able to hack your own score.So I tried to check what is the top five list scoring. 
6. Then I first tried with 200 score. Then still not able to make it to the top list meaning the top 5 are more than that.
   And if you play the game honestly , it is impossible to even acheive 200 points. After that I complaint again to the uniqlo but still
   no response and being ignored. You know lots of people trying very hard to play the game honestly but uniqlo are letting that happen.
   They do not apprecaite their supporter's time. Just let them waste their time playing.
7. Later I tried to hack to the highest score. It is more than 100k points. So no way they know who are deserved winner and 
   those created this game surely know how to hack the score. But messaging unqilo is disappointed with no response.They are wasting our time.
8. So that is the reason they do not want to reveal the score. So that they can manipulate the result anytime they wanted. This is just 
   marketing geek to lure people spend more on the RM10 voucher."
"Hello, thank you for your feedback and comments. We do have a monitoring system which filters any suspicious game play activity and eliminates these activities from our leaderboard to be fair to everyone who has spent time playing our game. From this monitoring system, we look into different aspects and different levels to make sure the game play is fair and those with suspicious game play will be eliminated automatically. As mentioned in our T&C, any suspicious game play will be eliminated without prior notification or without providing any reasons should the participant be suspected of tampering with their entries. Rest assured that we take this matter seriously. We hope this clarifies."
"why did not Uniqlo Malaysia reply to me in the first place when i was questioning about the fair play? Now only take out saying something like these yet the leaderboard still showing those scoring the scores impossible to reach? Do not that contradict with what you have just said? And I played fair and scored 162 and I contacted Uniqlo Malaysia but no reply at all from your side except read tick. Then later I try to resort to other method  to find out more about this cheat game. Please answer that if 162 able to make it to the top 5? You are just dodging my questioning all the time without ridrectly answer the our doubts. Good to taichi like that. In future , any game from uniqlo, I will try them to refer to this post."
"Sorry that we took awhile to reply your PM. Just to clarify, our leaderboard does not show scores of each participants and as mentioned, we are unable to reveal the winners scores but we can confirm that we have gone through our monitoring system to make sure they did not manipulate the game. We hope this clarifies all your questions. Thank you and have a nice day."
"Refer to my previous post, I was with 201 score but still not in the top 5 . So where are the filtering as you have said?"
see this is how uniqlo tries to hide things and not anwser to our answer directly. Fairness is surely not a value preached by them.
Where the Rm10 voucher? Don’t received
Maybe u should check the junk mail of ur email Inbox.
"Hi, do check your junk email folder and if you're still having trouble, do let us know :)"
"Hi Uniqlo, I am one of the the winner who has already reply to the email sent by one of your social media executive. In the email it has been stated that I will receive a confirmation once the prize is process. It has been more than a week and I have yet to receive any confirmation. And since the cny voucher is going to end soon, what will Uniqlo or in this case, me go about this? Please reply by today. I have already send a personal message to your fb which u have read but fail to reply to, I have also reply to the email to your social media executive who I will not reveal who it is yet.

This is a cheat game. I will try to compile a post later to show you guy how uniqlo cheat people but luring poeple playing but actually the top 5 list is manipulated all the time.
Please show the mark top 5
"Hi Uniqlo, why make the redemption only available from 16 February onward? CNY is suppose to be a happy celebration. Don't you think your loyal customers would be very happy if they can enjoy this promotion before CNY? Please think & be grateful to your loyal shoppers."
Very true..try to appreciate your customer!
what's the highest score anyway... -.- even 5th placing seems so impossible @@
"i got 120 also cant get top 5, it seems to be cheating"
😂 same goes to the previous events too.
Uniqlo Malaysia Is there any difference between the phone and the desktop version? I got 116 points for my last attempt on phone and I don't think I can get more than 200 even tho I have avoided all the dragon head and got all the oranges and gold.
"Hi Frederic, there's no difference between the two :)"
"I scored 141, still not in the top5.... 😢"
"there are no way to avoid all the lion head.......
i would request UNIQLO CHINESE NEW YEAR DASH
to show the score instead of just show the top 5"
It is a cheat game. No way can make it to the top list
I even can provide the proof of  it
Cheng Yang Teh seriously 141 ? dont miss anything?
Yamazaki Ry please proof it
"If you redeem through the physical store, make sure your phone have a data connection or else just like me, it's just a waste of time 😡"
"Please show the top scorer mark, all said u cheating,  please to proof that"
May I know the date and time when will the top 3 scorer will be finalized?
An item listed as RM 39.90 is no longer RM 39.90 after I chose a size. Don't make me excited for nothing. It hurts.
I think the top 5 scores are more than 300++

"Dear Uniqlo Malaysia, 

could you please make something like this for mommy’s style... I mean you give us mommies an idea how to look great in jeans.. oh please, don’t make the video with skinny mommies. Please find a model with average mommy body size... 

*I’m sure you got what I meant, I don’t want to be detail then people will accuse me of mommies body shaming.."
Unfortunately not for plus size ..the size for skinny one..why women jeans always fit like cant breath  ? I think male jeans so comfortable ..cant u do something about that.
Am I the only one think jeans don't look good on the model?

"Koh Wen Ying, have you tried contacting them at 1800-806758? Please allow some time to get back to you as only they will be able to access to your data. Thank you for your patience!"
Hi recently I had sent my item for refund but not yet get any news from you. I tried to call the toll free line but seem like that line is not working! Please reply. I had email and pm your page but still no reply!
"Hey there Wen Ying, sorry about that. We have received your direct message and have responded to you!"
I had sent the email and no one response to my email since yesterday. FB response is faster
"""Hi Wen Ying, for online purchase inquiries, have you contacted customer service at wecare@ml.uniqlo.com.my? As we do not have access to order data, they would be able to assist you better. Thank you.""

I had sent to the email"
"it is nt toll free line, u might be charged. and forget about calling them, they will tell u ""relevant department"" is checking and they dont know why refund taking so long. theh always tel u they already rushing ""relevant department"" but please la one month gone and they still dunwan refund me. i just lodege complaint at kpdnkk website yday and hopefully they will refund it asap or else i jus email their big boss from japan. pm me if u need their boss email"
"and not need email them, they wont reply. u try google it , alot victims wont be refunded"
i already provide my banking details in return slip and even in emails but lol one day they tell me they dont have my account holder name

"Uniqlo, change your delivery company please! my order #200245281 has not been delivered since order placed on 26/12/2017 despite the tracking status being out for delivery on 28/12/2017. GDEX is the worst of all delivery partners you could have. They do not pick up phones, and they are untruthful about the delivery status. Happened not once, but many times for other shopping websites who use them."

"will never buy online anymore. Took more than one week for delivery in KL, and when I returned the items because of the size not fitted, it has taken one month and will take another one month to get the refund, I wish I can get back my money,total RM 179.80,Tq."
"Hey Angela, so sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience. We will send you a message for more information regarding your refund. Once again, sorry!"
Uniqlo Malaysia the time takes for return is really unreasonable long.Anyway I will thank you if you can help in this case.Order Number:200235576. Thank you.
"forget about calling them, they will tell u ""relevant department"" is checking and they dont know why refund taking so long. theh always tel u they already rushing ""relevant department"" but please la one month gone and they still dunwan refund me. i just lodege complaint at kpdnkk website yday and hopefully they will refund it asap or else i jus email their big boss from japan. pm me if u need their boss email"
"already got refund last week, finally settled after more than one month.they did not deduct any cost for the delivery, that is good. Because I think that is my mistake to chose the wrong size,I should bear the cost for delivery. The only problem is the refund takes a long time.hopefully UNIQLO can improve at this part."
"BTW I really think UNIQLO online purchase will be a failure due to the slow service, the online system is totally a daily advertisement that send   Ad every day"

aku suka uniqlo baju simple. kaler pun bright dull gia jak. aok eh tangan nya buruk.
Tapi cam over priced nangga ku mun kau compare ngan hnm / fos / bo / ctn on.
Izzat Al Hadi yup. sebaab ya juak la aku jarang beli sia. HnM kadang2 murah gik. Aku preffer HnM salu. Cotton On nya fancy gilak. Brand Outlet angol ku. hahahah
"aku prefer fos, sebab baju nya casual and selesa mun pakey. Harga pun murah. Tapi mun baju kolar biasa ku beli kat BO."
Izzat Al Hadi aku carik baju simple jak. Fos sometimes jak aku berkenan. Hahaha. BO aku beli seluar salu. HnM tgga Walllet lok. Mun ada sale xplu tgga wallet. hahahahah
