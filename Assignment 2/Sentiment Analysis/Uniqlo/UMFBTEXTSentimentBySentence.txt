I bebas pilih baju tanpa stress kena suspect mencurik!!!!! tapi I terpaksa back to times square pulak. second  time for today sebab Fahrenheit kurang pilihan. u know lepas I masuk sana times square branch your security sudah tak act macam 1st I masuk 1 hour ealier!  why?????????? and second time I complaint to counter staff a Chinese guy. He apologize on behave of the security guard.  i bukan sekali je masuk uniqlo ye.
