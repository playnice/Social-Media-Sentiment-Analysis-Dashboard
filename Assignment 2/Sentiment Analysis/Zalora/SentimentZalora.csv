Important Info !,positive
BEWARE BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING from this #poplook premium range for Zalora.,neutral
I bought this item from Zalora and did not realise that it is non refundable / exchangeable unlike the other products.,negative
It did not fit well on me and I would like to return it but realise that I could not and it costs RM 219!!,negative
It does not make any sense to me to not be able to make a choice after trying or even to exchange it to something that fits.,positive
Now I can only leave it sitting in my cupboard or throwing out a perfectly beautiful piece of clothing.,positive
Hi You Ting Tan.,neutral
"POPLOOK Premium for ZALORA, is a non-returnable item.",neutral
"Which means that, this item is not valid for returns, refunds and exchanges.",neutral
It is stated at the website on the page of the item.,neutral
We are so sorry.,negative
ZALORA have you ever wondered why this particular item is non returnable?,positive
May I know why?,neutral
It is not an underwear or jewellery which will be soiled.,neutral
Especially due to the price range I would expect a decent amount of right as a consumer.,positive
"It is stated in the small print on the website, which is very obscure.",negative
I recommend you make it as obvious as possible the terms of this item as I believe that anyone who buy this item will feel cheated just like me if it does not fit.,negative
ZALORA I admit that it is my fault for not looking at the fine print of each and every one of the items I put in my basket but anyway I will not take the risk of this by purchasing from Zalora in the future.,positive
"Even though your customer service has replied very promptly and I'm so far satisfied with the speed of response but with such illogical terms that I cannot receive any further explanation via email and here other than it is stated on the website ( fine print ) and sorry can't help you there, it is simply unacceptable.",positive
Also you cannot highlight 30 day free returns as per the photo attached as this is misleading.,positive
It implies that everything on the site is eligible for 30 day free returns.,positive
I feel extremely cheated.,negative
