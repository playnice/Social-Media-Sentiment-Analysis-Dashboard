Though he apologised after I explained that I was not done yet, the main issue was that he should have asked me first if I had done using the leg press instead of jumping into conclusion that I purposely left the weights there.  If I were to conduct a training session on communication skill for your staff, the first rule is seek to understand before being understood : You ask others for further details or confirmation before jumping into any conclusion. In any circumstances, it is always a smart move to give people the benefit of the doubt, isn't ?  The past is past but my concentration was affected by the interruption and I was unhappy over it and his uncompromising attitude.

I'd say CHI is not the most expensive and is quite reasonably priced -therefore, I asked for the Management to take account into Customer Service, branding consistency and quality of the facilities at the gyms. For many weeks (at the same gym), some Mics have been spoilt and pity the instructors who have to shout throughout the class, the hooks in the shower not replaced for over 6 months (Mr. DIY is just next door?), water dispenser not working and other misc things which is still happening today. Since the membership is reasonably priced this does not means amenities and customer service has to be compromised. I enjoy the classes and there are many supporters of CHI. To the Management (and not just Marketing or PR Dept), please take this seriously and members will just port out to other gyms which is only 10-20% more expensive since the overall quality of the gym is deteriorating. Please remember that many of us seek to have a overall well-being experience at gyms. Walk the talk.

Upon enquiry, gym staff mentioned that it will be fixed within that week itself.   2nd Week. Come the following week of 22 Jan 2018. I enquired the gym staff, again they said it will be fixed within the week itself. This time I called up the gym manager as well. He mentioned that payment is being processed and he will personally follow up and fix the hot water shower within the week of 22 Jan 2018.   3rd week arrived. 29 Jan 2018 week.  Enquired again.  Same response. Will be fixed within the week itself because payment is being processed.  How long does it take for the management to approve a single payment in this age and time? It doesn't seem like any action is being taken, nor complaints is being heeded. Also, since there's no hot shower, management is actually saving electricity tremendously. They should be giving the poor ladies who have to endure the cold shower early in the mornings refunds in their gym membership!","Sentiment":-0.25,"Source":"Facebook Review Chi Fitness"},{"Content":"I am extremely dissapointed. My gf and I both enrolled with Chi Fitness because I was tempted by their October Deepavali promotion. I cancelled a day after I enrolled because the gym centre was too pack, it is totally different than what the manager who showed me around during the Deepavali public holiday, and said 'it is always like this, not too crowded'. The next day I went for gym, I have to queue for any machines. So since it was stated on the agreement I will not be charged if I cancel within 5 days after enrol, both of us filled up the cancellation form the next day after enrolling. That was October. The system continue charging me RM149.00 from November and December. Apparently Chi Fitness only cancelled 1 account and lost the cancellation form for another account. This is my 3rd time going back to the same branch to ask them for refund.  Their staff keep saying 'we cannot refund and cancel until we found the firm's. Hey man, third time I return, and today, went back to ask for the status. A staff said : well we cannot refund, and we will still charge u another month. I believe they will cancel your account and refund later but we will still charge you???? What is going on. I guess the next round I will not return to them to ask for the status. I will report to the police since this is a fraud case.","Sentiment":-4.375,"Source":"Facebook Review Chi Fitness"},{"Content":"I would like to address my concern regarding to the customer service issues to Chi-X Fitness - Starling Mall management.   Below are the two incidents which happened during my recent visits:  No hot water supply- at the end of January 2018 I understood that it might not the tenant's problem as water supply should be part of the mall facility management.  However I think that the gym management could do better in sending a SMS or at least an email to inform the customers about the inconvenience in advance. I could not tolerate where I was told to have e a cold shower in the early morning at 7 am once I reached the gym, the worse case is that I was having an upcoming important appointment at 9 am nearby which I got no other alternatives to go for. It definitely ruined my day!  Fire Drill at the mall- today (08.02.2018) I believe that all tenants have been well informed by the mall management if there is any fire drill practice. Please do better in sending an SMS or at least an email to inform the customer in advance. I was rushing out from the bathroom this morning as I am not sure whether it was a real fire alarm a or just a fire drill practice.  I would not want to risk my life for that uncertainty. Kindly imagine the uncomfortable and inconvenience which caused to your customers.
