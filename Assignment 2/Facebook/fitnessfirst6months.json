I sustained a muscle/tendon injury during one of my sessions there so had to stop and freeze my account with a doctor's letter. However after 6 months they reactivated my account without first informing me or asking if I was okay to return. I did not check my credit card bill for a few months but when I did I realized they had charged me for 6 months already. Cut a long story short. I tried to cancel my membership (I was not on contract anymore) because my shoulder was still stiff and there was no way I could return to my normal classes. Tried to cancel my membership and ask for a refund on the 6 months fees that they tried to charge. It was impossible for them to agree. I have been fighting to get my money back and for them to waive the freezing fees to no avail.",

            "message": "Dear Sir / Madam\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank Fitness First for organising the event ‚ÄúFit In The City‚Äù on 4 Nov 2017, the very first event that I chanced upon and took part with my other group exercise members from Fitness First at The Gardens Mall.\n\nIt was definitely challenging as there were 11 thrilling obstacles for us to go through as a team.\nI am happy to share that our team completed the obstacle challenge with each other‚Äôs support and we did enjoy ourselves.\n\nThough it was meant to be a test of our strength, endurance and cardio, I was very concerned about several safety issues as I felt that the safety measures at a number of obstacle challenges were not sufficient and not well thought out, specifically:\n\nMost of the obstacles challenges were not set up properly, as some of the safety mattresses/ cushions were not firmly installed and were scattered around.  Some of these did not even have any mattress/cushion even though the risk of injury was obvious. \n\nEach of the obstacle challenges should have been more closely supervised by the training staff. As safety measures were lacking, a fall could potentially result in a serious head injury. Some of them were not very alert or attentive even though the risk of head injuries was imminent. Our team had to cover the hard floor and move the cushion around as there wasn‚Äôt sufficient cushioning.\n\nThere was no medical assistance given to my team member who injured herself.  \n\nThe last obstacle was not secured and the balance beam was very shaky for anyone to walk on. This was the case for the last obstacle challenge - the beam on the left was obviously not set up in a correct manner.\n\nMay I know who is the person in charge to write to regarding this? Can I have the email address as I couldn't find it on your website.\n\nThank you. \n\nYours truly\nDylan Ng\nMembership No. 80010658",

I know that my 1 year tenure is coming end of Sept. Hence, its just nice as to serve a 1 month notice. Was told that Azwan Avenue K will call me in to assist on my cancellation, nobody did. \n\nThen I walked in to confirm on my cancellation, apparently was told that Azwan was on leave for travelling, Geeta took my case. \n\nToday I called in again to confirm(answered by Azil), was told that Geeta is on 2 weeks leave. Another manager will take my case, which interestingly that person is not around today as was told that the person needs to take care of two clubs.\n\nI just want a confirmation that 30 Sept is my last day as I don't want to continue anymore. I hope I don't have to do a police report on this matter.\n\n-Ezir Kushairi",
