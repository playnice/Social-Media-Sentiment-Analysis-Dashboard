My intention is to terminate with immediate effect (which was told is 1 month notice, why is my friend been terminated immediately by FF without any reason) but end up with 2 months notice?

They will take your money without your authorization. I sustained a muscle/tendon injury during one of my sessions there so had to stop and freeze my account with a doctor's letter.

I didn't check my credit card bill for a few months but when I did I realized they had charged me for 6 months already. Cut a long story short. I tried to cancel my membership (I was not on contract anymore) because my shoulder was still stiff and there was no way I could return to my normal classes. Tried to cancel my membership and ask for a refund on the 6 months fees that they tried to charge. It was impossible for them to agree. I have been fighting to get my money back and for them to waive the freezing fees to no avail. This club does not care about their members.
