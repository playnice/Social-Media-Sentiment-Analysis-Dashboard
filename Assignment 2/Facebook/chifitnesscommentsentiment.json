We caught up with this contender to uncover the motivation behind the man. \n\nQ: When and how did you start your fitness journey?\nA: I stepped into the fitness industry about 9 years ago, and have been actively competing since 2014. \n\nQ: What are your tips to stay in shape?\nA: Here are some VITAL tips for you guys out there:\n\n1. This is not new; watch your diet. If you haven\u2019t started cutting back on sugar and oil yet, start soon! Give yourself a minimum of 2 weeks, and trust me - you\u2019ll see some positive changes. \n\n2. Our lives are driven by the goals\/targets we want to achieve. The same goes for fitness. Set your goals for weeks or months ahead. Be persistent in order to stay in shape. \n\nQ: What is your advice for people who want to start on this fitness journey?\nA: Step out of a sedentary lifestyle and get yourself going with basic fitness exercises and simple routines. They can be as easy as outdoor activities, joining bootcamps and some weight training. Do not ever torture yourself, but go slow and steady. Seek advice or hire a professional. Again, persistence is always the key! \n\nQ: What are some of the challenges that you've faced throughout your fitness journey?\nA: As many know, I have a platinum-plated rod permanently implanted in my left leg. My worst downfall was after the surgery, 24th of september 2013 to be exact. At the time, I'd been granted medical leave of one year! The implantation leads to limitation in my movement, giving me much difficulty in training legs. God knows! As a full time CHi Senior Fitness Trainer, I must tell you that my time is downright haywire! So I have to know how to manage my time. Its even worse when it comes to competing season. \n\nQ: What do you think about cheat days? Are you more like \"We're all humans, they are normal.\" or \"Absolutely not!\", and why?\nA: I must say it\u2019s a big YES! The concept is actually simple. I eat. I do not binge eat. I cheat. I do not eat junk. I still track my macros and whenever my food goes beyond my daily caloric intake, that's when I know that I'd have to make love to my treadmill.  I have to do cardio to burn those extra calories. \n\nQ:  Have you ever had times where you felt down? How do you keep yourself motivated at all times?\nA: Of course I do! Rough times and tough times come and go. I keep myself motivated by staying close to positive people. Sometimes I talk to a close buddy of mine and my loved ones. Last but not least, God is always there to listen. Speak to Him.","Comment":"steady bro harizon ramli","Topic":"","Sentiment":-0.5,"Source":"Facebook Comment Chi Fitness"},{"Post":"It takes a lean, mean machine to compete in the likes of the WFF Asia Pacific Pro\/Am Championships 2017, and our very own Harizon fits the bill to a tee.
