Of late I have been going for classes at Paradigm and empire for the past one year with Empire being my home gym. Today after classes in paradigm as usual I would take a shower get changed n leave. BUT today some member stole my gym shoes which was put with many shoes under the bench. This is the first time in years that when I left my shoes outside the locker that it was stolen! Yes it's my mistake of leaving it outside but this was a norm as the shoes would be wet. I'm not asking for any compensation or anything of such. I would just like to express my greatest disappointment on how would the other gym members steal from the gym, has this ever happen?!? Appreciate if you could check on the security of the gym\/ type of ppl that join as members or maybe even ppl that join on trial and also acknowledge that this actually did happen at your Paradigm Fitness First Centre.   This is specifically to PARADIGM FITNESS FIRST, Rest assured I have no problem with the quality of the gym in other any areas.","Topic":"member,years,classes,paradigm,empire,year,empire,home,gym,today,classes,paradigm,get,today,member,gym,shoes,shoes,bench,time,years,shoes,locker,yes,mistake,norm,shoes,compensation,disappointment,members,gym,security,type,join,members,join,trial,paradigm,centre,problem,quality,gym,areas","Sentiment":-0.75,"Source":"Facebook Review Fitness First"},{"Review":"Setia City mall class schedule in app and website both stated there is a 9.45am pilates class.

There is no other way to explain why hardly anyone wipes the equipment after use or even places a towel between their soaked body and the machines.

Not even the trainers display basic hygiene but using towels \/ wiping equipment.

Went to the club at Axis yesterday. Was surprised the weights equipments and stepboard in the GX room are those old ones. (Not sure other normal clubs r same). That is fine. But the main concern is the slippery flooring in GX room. Not sure if any member brought up this issue before.

I walked in to The Curve branch where I registered, filled the form and even got a cancellation email. But I am really disappointed that they keep on charging me the fees via direct debit. The latest one was yesterday, 21 November 2017. I lost almost RM1000 for the membership that supposed to be TERMINATED already. I have called to complain numerous times and when talking to staffs  there got me nowhere, I asked to speak to the manager. But, the manager seemed to be busy or in a meeting everytime. Everytime I called, the staff would say that the manager already addressing the issue, will terminate my membership and even promise to compensate the money that I paid. Months passed since then and I feel really angry even to call because I know it will get me nowhere. Maybe I should make a complaint elsewhere since asking politely to the branch involved seems useless.","Topic":"membership,curve,branch,form,cancellation,email,fees,debit,one,yesterday,november,membership,times,manager,manager,meeting,staff,manager,issue,membership,money,months,complaint,branch","Sentiment":-1.375,"Source":"Facebook Review Fitness First"},{"Review":"I have been informed very friendly by your front desk that fitness first Melawati Mall is only open to new sign up MM members.

The staff who promised left after I rejoined. When I confromted. fitness First,  they feign ignorance and put the blame on me,  that I didnt secure a black and white. When I was given my contract I had already highlighted it was not the rate I was offered. I was again told it will be rectified.  Finally I asked someone by the name of Alex who gave a false promise he will rectify the matter who also failed to follow through and assigned the blame on me.

I turned rounds and rounds to find parking in the mall and rushed into the gym to find that your Gentle Flow Yoga class at 730pm is not available?  There is nobody there. I have checked the club timetable just before coming and the class is on! Your counter person dont even know there is nobody there. She was even in disbelief and I had to double check it twice for her. She said the class is supposed to be on and she had to text to realise there is no class and just say a simple sorry. Do you know how much hassle or effort people put through to commute to the gym? Do you know how idiotic it feels to come to your gym and to be put off by the class is not on? And you do not bother to maintain the quality of your service?  When you are comfortably having your dinner now, I am fucking pissed with your club's services. Being a world renowed Fitness First, is this how you treat your customer?  I was your member for 7 years at the Curve. The same thing happened few times. You use your club studio for your own internal functions and not informing your customer. Frequently I was so disappointed to only realised classes cancel only upon at your club premise.  Seems like your club service has not improved after all these years. Bloody disappointing Fitness First! Nobody cares and just take this lightly. I really have zero confidence in your classes now.

They will take your money without your authorization. I sustained a muscle\/tendon injury during one of my sessions there so had to stop and freeze my account with a doctor's letter. However after 6 months they reactivated my account without first informing me or asking if I was okay to return. I didn't check my credit card bill for a few months but when I did I realized they had charged me for 6 months already. Cut a long story short. I tried to cancel my membership (I was not on contract anymore) because my shoulder was still stiff and there was no way I could return to my normal classes. Tried to cancel my membership and ask for a refund on the 6 months fees that they tried to charge. It was impossible for them to agree. I have been fighting to get my money back and for them to waive the freezing fees to no avail. This club does not care about their members.
