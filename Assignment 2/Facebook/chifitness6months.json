We caught up with her to talk about what keeps her motivated & fit. \n\nQ: When and how did you start your fitness journey?\nA: Well, I was active from the time I was a teenager - playing basketball and tennis, and swimming. But following my pregnancy, there was a big gap [of resting] for me. I did try, after a while, to bring myself back [to exercise]. Then, when I came to Malaysia, I decided to take it more seriously. So I registered as a member and that was how it started.\n\nQ: What are your tips to stay in shape?\nA: Consistency, discipline and, of course, watch what you eat. I do not mean go on diet, since I actually eat all the time. It is more about making better choices and fueling up in the right way.\n\nQ: What is your advice for people who want to start on this fitness journey?\nA: Be patient - changes are not gonna happen in one week, one month; it takes time. Most people quit within the first three month and I can say it is because they probably have not seen any changes. You only start to see results after six months, and even then, slowly. You see fit people but you do not see how long they have been working hard to reach that stage; being mentally strong is sometimes more important. So, be patient, work hard and trust me, it is gonna happen.\n\nQ: What are some of the challenges that you have faced throughout your fitness journey?\nA: Well, I am very weak in gymnastic skills, so I really try to get better [at it], but progress is slow. Meal prep is also a challenge since I started working full-time. And to be honest, like every other human being, there are days where I really feel I cannot [do anything], but I push myself to get it done.\n\nQ: What do you think about cheat days? \nA: I have cheat days, it is an absolute yes for me, because we should enjoy life too. Workout and diet should be a lifestyle, while cheat meals provide you the motivation to work hard. But do not succumb to it every day - maybe once a week and for one meal.\n\nQ: Do you have downtimes too? How do you keep yourself motivated at all times?\nA: Yes, of course. I think about my goals and try to stay on track. If you can find a way to enjoy [the exercise], then you will not need motivation, because you will do it with love.",

We caught up with this contender to uncover the motivation behind the man. \n\nQ: When and how did you start your fitness journey?\nA: I stepped into the fitness industry about 9 years ago, and have been actively competing since 2014. \n\nQ: What are your tips to stay in shape?\nA: Here are some VITAL tips for you guys out there:\n\n1. This is not new; watch your diet. If you haven’t started cutting back on sugar and oil yet, start soon! Give yourself a minimum of 2 weeks, and trust me - you’ll see some positive changes. \n\n2. Our lives are driven by the goals/targets we want to achieve. The same goes for fitness. Set your goals for weeks or months ahead. Be persistent in order to stay in shape. \n\nQ: What is your advice for people who want to start on this fitness journey?\nA: Step out of a sedentary lifestyle and get yourself going with basic fitness exercises and simple routines. They can be as easy as outdoor activities, joining bootcamps and some weight training. Do not ever torture yourself, but go slow and steady. Seek advice or hire a professional. Again, persistence is always the key! \n\nQ: What are some of the challenges that you've faced throughout your fitness journey?\nA: As many know, I have a platinum-plated rod permanently implanted in my left leg. My worst downfall was after the surgery, 24th of september 2013 to be exact. At the time, I'd been granted medical leave of one year! The implantation leads to limitation in my movement, giving me much difficulty in training legs. God knows! As a full time CHi Senior Fitness Trainer, I must tell you that my time is downright haywire! So I have to know how to manage my time. Its even worse when it comes to competing season. \n\nQ: What do you think about cheat days? Are you more like \"We're all humans, they are normal.\" or \"Absolutely not!\", and why?\nA: I must say it’s a big YES! The concept is actually simple. I eat. I do not binge eat. I cheat. I do not eat junk. I still track my macros and whenever my food goes beyond my daily caloric intake, that's when I know that I'd have to make love to my treadmill.  I have to do cardio to burn those extra calories. \n\nQ:  Have you ever had times where you felt down? How do you keep yourself motivated at all times?\nA: Of course I do! Rough times and tough times come and go. I keep myself motivated by staying close to positive people. Sometimes I talk to a close buddy of mine and my loved ones. Last but not least, God is always there to listen. Speak to Him.",

Start in a standing position in which your body is upright and your spine is neutral.\n2. Position your feet slightly wider than your shoulder-width, toes turning out and keep your legs straight.\n3. Hold your chest up and raise your arms straight out in front of you, palms facing down. \n4. Breath in and hinge your hips back by bending at your knees and hips, allowing your hips to ease backwards. \n5. Keep your spine neutral and ensure that the bend in your knees follows the line of your feet.\n6. Squat down until your thighs are parallel to the floor ( or further if you have good hip mobility). Pause, then return to the starting position.",
