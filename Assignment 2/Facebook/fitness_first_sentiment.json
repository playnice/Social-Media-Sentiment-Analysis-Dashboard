Of late I have been going for classes at Paradigm and empire for the past one year with Empire being my home gym. Today after classes in paradigm as usual I would take a shower get changed n leave. BUT today some member stole my gym shoes which was put with many shoes under the bench. This is the first time in years that when I left my shoes outside the locker that it was stolen! Yes it's my mistake of leaving it outside but this was a norm as the shoes would be wet. I'm not asking for any compensation or anything of such. I would just like to express my greatest disappointment on how would the other gym members steal from the gym, has this ever happen?!? Appreciate if you could check on the security of the gym\/ type of ppl that join as members or maybe even ppl that join on trial and also acknowledge that this actually did happen at your Paradigm Fitness First Centre.   This is specifically to PARADIGM FITNESS FIRST, Rest assured I have no problem with the quality of the gym in other any areas.","Sentiment":-0.75,"Source":"Facebook Review Fitness First"},{"Content":"Setia City mall class schedule in app and website both stated there is a 9.45am pilates class.

But the main concern is the slippery flooring in GX room. Not sure if any member brought up this issue before.

I have called to complain numerous times and when talking to staffs  there got me nowhere, I asked to speak to the manager. But, the manager seemed to be busy or in a meeting everytime. Everytime I called, the staff would say that the manager already addressing the issue, will terminate my membership and even promise to compensate the money that I paid.

I have checked the club timetable just before coming and the class is on! Your counter person dont even know there is nobody there. She was even in disbelief and I had to double check it twice for her. She said the class is supposed to be on and she had to text to realise there is no class and just say a simple sorry.

And you do not bother to maintain the quality of your service?  When you are comfortably having your dinner now, I am fucking pissed with your club's services. Being a world renowed Fitness First, is this how you treat your customer?  I was your member for 7 years at the Curve. The same thing happened few times. You use your club studio for your own internal functions and not informing your customer. Frequently I was so disappointed to only realised classes cancel only upon at your club premise.  Seems like your club service has not improved after all these years. Bloody disappointing Fitness First! Nobody cares and just take this lightly. I really have zero confidence in your classes now.

Tried to cancel my membership and ask for a refund on the 6 months fees that they tried to charge. It was impossible for them to agree.

It was definitely challenging as there were 11 thrilling obstacles for us to go through as a team. I am happy to share that our team completed the obstacle challenge with each other\u2019s support and we did enjoy ourselves.  Though it was meant to be a test of our strength, endurance and cardio, I was very concerned about several safety issues as I felt that the safety measures at a number of obstacle challenges were not sufficient and not well thought out, specifically:  Most of the obstacles challenges were not set up properly, as some of the safety mattresses\/ cushions were not firmly installed and were scattered around.  Some of these did not even have any mattress\/cushion even though the risk of injury was obvious.   Each of the obstacle challenges should have been more closely supervised by the training staff. As safety measures were lacking, a fall could potentially result in a serious head injury. Some of them were not very alert or attentive even though the risk of head injuries was imminent. Our team had to cover the hard floor and move the cushion around as there wasn\u2019t sufficient cushioning.  There was no medical assistance given to my team member who injured herself.    The last obstacle was not secured and the balance beam was very shaky for anyone to walk on. This was the case for the last obstacle challenge - the beam on the left was obviously not set up in a correct manner.  May I know who is the person in charge to write to regarding this? Can I have the email address as I couldn't find it on your website.  Thank you.

I sustained a muscle\/tendon injury during one of my sessions there so had to stop and freeze my account with a doctor's letter. However after 6 months they reactivated my account without first informing me or asking if I was okay to return. I did not check my credit card bill for a few months but when I did I realized they had charged me for 6 months already. Cut a long story short. I tried to cancel my membership (I was not on contract anymore) because my shoulder was still stiff and there was no way I could return to my normal classes. Tried to cancel my membership and ask for a refund on the 6 months fees that they tried to charge. It was impossible for them to agree. I have been fighting to get my money back and for them to waive the freezing fees to no avail.","Sentiment":-5.5,"Source":"Facebook Comment Fitness First"},{"Content":"FF SCM will be closed on these date?","Sentiment":0.375,"Source":"Facebook Comment Fitness First"},{"Content":"FF SCM, i think notice like this should be send out via SMS \/ Email rather than just through a FB page announcement.
